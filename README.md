This repository contains the backend code for a programming educational website. The aim of the website is to offer a platform where users can learn programming languages and concepts through a range of interactive exercises and quizzes.

The backend is built using Python and the Django framework. It includes a RESTful API that serves data to the frontend of the website. The API is used to handle user authentication and session management, as well as to store and retrieve user progress on various exercises and quizzes.

Additionally, the backend includes a database that stores information about users, exercises, quizzes, and their respective solutions and answers. The database is implemented using SQLite, with SQLAlchemy used as a Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.

The backend is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with well-organized code and clear documentation to facilitate contribution from other developers. It is also intended to be deployed to a cloud platform, such as AWS or Azure, using containerization technologies such as Docker.

If you'd like to contribute to this project and help us bring quality programming education to more people, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
